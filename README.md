## About the Project

### Why Better Auth?

> Auth feels like a partially solved problem in the ecosystem. Existing open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond a simple login. Third-party services, while convenient, comes with their own set of problems. And obviously, these services aren't free and can get really expensive. 

> Better auth is born out of these frustrations. It aims to provides a comprehensive authentication library from the core accompanied by a growings plugin ecosystem, that allows you to add many auth related features in short amount of time.


### Goals
****

- **Be Comprehensive**: Save users from reinventing the wheel for anything related auth.
- **Prioritize Best Practices**: provide best practices rather than overwhelming configuration options.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support most frameworks and avoid framework specific features and solutions if possible.
- **Consistency**: Provide a consistent and predictable API across all platforms
- **Type Safety**: Value type-safety and embrace typescript magic when necessary.

### Non-Goals
****

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: We wonâ€™t support JWT-based auth unless provided by a third-party plugin.
- **Support for Non-Relational Databases**: No plans to support MongoDB or other non-relational databases.
- **Deep Customization**: Our focus is on delivering opinionated, best-practice defaults, rather than enabling deep customization.
- **Frontend UI Components**: We donâ€™t provide frontend UI components. However, feel free to use our examples for quick UI integration.

> Some of these non-goals might change after we hit v1
