## About the Project

### Why Better Auth?

Auth is a partly solved problem. Open-source libraries often need extra code for anything beyond basic login, while third-party services, though convenient, bring their own challengesâ€”and can get expensive fast.

Better Auth was built to tackle these frustrations. It offers a robust core authentication library, supported by a growing plugin ecosystem, allowing you to quickly add advanced auth features with minimal effort.


### Goals
****

- **Be Comprehensive**: Save users from reinventing the wheel for anything related auth.
- **Prioritize Best Practices**: provide best practices rather than overwhelming configuration options.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support most frameworks and avoid framework specific features and solutions if possible.
- **Consistency**: Provide a consistent and predictable API across all platforms
- **Type Safety**: Value type-safety and embrace typescript magic when necessary.

### Non-Goals
****

- **JWT-Based Authentication**: We wonâ€™t support JWT-based auth unless provided by a third-party plugin.
- **Support for Non-Relational Databases**: No plans to support MongoDB or other non-relational databases.
- **Deep Customization**: Our focus is on delivering opinionated, best-practice defaults, rather than enabling deep customization.
