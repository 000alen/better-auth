# Better Auth

Framework-agnostic, Comprehensive, extensible authentication library for TypeScript.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm i better-auth
```


## Project Goals

- **Prioritize Best Practices**: Focus on delivering best practices instead of extensive configuration options.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Aim to be framework-independent by using general solutions whenever possible, avoiding framework-specific dependencies as much as possible.
- **Comprehensive Offerings**: Provide a wide range of utilities to prevent reinventing the wheel for any authentication-related tasks.
- **Embrace Type Safety**: Value type-safety. Embrace typescript magic.
- **Universal Functionality**: Try to make the server side of better-auth as universal as possible.
