## Why Better Auth?

> Authentication feels like a partially solved problem, existing open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond a simple login. Third-party services, while convenient, force you to store user data on their servers, which in some ways strips you of ownership and it also comes with its own set of problems. And obviously, these services aren't free and can get really expensive. 
Better auth is born out of these frustrations. It aims to provides a comprehensive authentication library from the core accompanied by a growings plugin ecosystem, that allows you to add many auth related features in short amount of time.
