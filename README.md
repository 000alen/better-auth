## About the Project

### Why Better Auth?

> Auth feels like a partially solved problem in the ecosystem. Existing open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond a simple login. Third-party services, while convenient, comes with their own set of problems. And obviously, these services aren't free and can get really expensive. 

> Better auth is born out of these frustrations. It aims to provides a comprehensive authentication library from the core accompanied by a growings plugin ecosystem, that allows you to add many auth related features in short amount of time.


### Goals
****

- **Be Comprehensive**: The goal is to save users from reinventing the wheel for anything related auth.
- **Prioritize Best Practices**: provide best practices rather than overwhelming users with configuration options.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support most frameworks.
- **Consistency**: Provide a consistent and predictable API across all platforms
- **Type Safety**: Value type-safety and embrace typescript magic when necessary.

### Non Goals
****

- **JWT Based Authentication**:  Unless implemented by 3rd party plugin we wont be supporting jwt based auth.
- **Supporting Non Relational Databases**: No plan to support mongo db or other no relational dbs.
- **Deep Customization**: Focus instead on providing opinionated, best-practice defaults.


### Planned Before v1.0
****

When something is started being worked on they will have "-" status and "x" where we're done.
