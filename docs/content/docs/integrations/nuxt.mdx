description: Learn how to integrate Better Auth with Nuxt.js
---


## Installation

First, install Better Auth

```package-install
npm install better-auth
```

## Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

**Set Base URL**
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Base URL of your Next.js app
```

**Set Secret**

Random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. You can generate one using the button below or you can use something like openssl.
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
```

<GenerateSecret/>

## Configure Server

### Create Better Auth instance

We recommend to create `auth.ts` file inside your `lib/` directory. This file will contain your Better Auth instance.

```ts twoslash title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite", //change this to your database provider
        url: "./db.sqlite", // path to your database or connection string
    }
    // Refer to the api documentation for more configuration options
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
Better Auth currently supports only SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It uses Kysely under the hood, so you can also pass any Kysely dialect directly to the database object.
</Callout>

### Create API Route

We need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a file inside `/server/api` called `[...auth].ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="server/api/[...auth].ts"
import { auth } from "~/utils/auth.config";

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
	return auth.handler(toWebRequest(event));
});
```
<Callout type="info">
 You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/[...auth]`
</Callout>

### Migrate the database
Run the following command to create the necessary tables in your database:

```bash
npx better-auth migrate
```

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts twoslash title="client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/vue" // make sure to import from better-auth/vue

export const client = createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actinos are reactive. The client use [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and re-render the components when the state changes. 

### Example usage

```vue title="index.vue"
<template>
    <div style="">
        <button v-if="!client.useSession().value" @click="() => client.signIn.social({
            provider: 'github'
        })">
            Continue with github
        </button>
        <div>
            <pre>{{ client.useSession().value }}</pre>
            <button v-if="client.useSession().value" @click="client.signOut()">
                Sign out
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```
