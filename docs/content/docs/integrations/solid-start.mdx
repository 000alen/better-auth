## Installation

First, install Better Auth

```package-install
npm install better-auth
```

## Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

**Set Base URL**
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Base URL of your Next.js app
```

**Set Secret**

Random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. You can generate one using the button below or you can use something like openssl.
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
```

<GenerateSecret/>

## Configure Server

### Create Better Auth instance

We recommend to create `auth.ts` file inside your `lib/` directory. This file will contain your Better Auth instance.

```ts twoslash title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const { api, handler } = betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite", //change this to your database provider
        url: "./db.sqlite", // path to your database or connection string
    }
    // Refer to the api documentation for more configuration options
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
Better Auth currently supports only SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It uses Kysely under the hood, so you can also pass any Kysely dialect directly to the database object.
</Callout>

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to Solid Start server. Put the following code in your `*auth.ts` file inside `/routes/api/auth` folder.

```ts title="*auth.ts"
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth";
import { toSolidStartHandler } from "better-auth/solid-start";

export const { GET, POST } = toSolidStartHandler(auth);
```
