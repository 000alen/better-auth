description: Hono Integration Guide
---

This integration guide is assuming you are using Hono with node server.

## Installation

First, install Better Auth

```package-install
npm install better-auth
```

## Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

**Set Base URL**
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Base URL of your Next.js app
```

**Set Secret**

Random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. You can generate one using the button below or you can use something like openssl.
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
```
<GenerateSecret/>

## Configure Server

### Create Better Auth instance

We recommend to create `auth.ts` file inside your `lib/` directory. This file will contain your Better Auth instance.

```ts twoslash title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const { api, handler } = betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite", //change this to your database provider
        url: "./db.sqlite", // path to your database or connection string
    }
    // Refer to the api documentation for more configuration options
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
Better Auth currently supports only SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It uses Kysely under the hood, so you can also pass any Kysely dialect directly to the database object.
</Callout>

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to hono endpoint.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { auth } from "./auth";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";

const app = new Hono();

app.on(["POST", "GET"], "/api/auth/**", (c) => {
	return auth.handler(c.req.raw);
});

serve(app);
```
