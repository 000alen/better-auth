description: Integrate Better Auth with Node backend
---

Better auth can be integrated with node based backed frameworks. The guide below will show you how to integrate better auth with express.

## Installation

First, install Better Auth

```package-install
npm install better-auth
```



## Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

**Set Base URL**
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Base URL of your application 
```

<Callout>
if you're using a custom path other than `/api/auth` make sure to provider the full path in the `BETTER_AUTH_URL` variable. For example, if you're using `/custom-path` as the path, you should set `BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/custom-path`. You can also provide path directly in the better auth options.
</Callout>


**Set Secret**

Random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. You can generate one using the button below or you can use something like openssl.

```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
```

<GenerateSecret/>

## Configuring Better Auth

### Create Better Auth instance

Create a `auth.ts` file in one of these directories: 

- `.` (root directory)
- `lib/`
- `src/`
- `utils/`

This file will contain your Better Auth instance.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { BetterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = new BetterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite", //change this to your database provider
        url: "./db.sqlite", // path to your database or connection string
    },
})
```

<Callout>
Refer to the [api documentation](/docs/api) on how to configure better auth.
</Callout>

### Migrate the database

You'll need to run the migration command to create the necessary tables in the database.


```bash
npx better-auth migrate
```

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a catch-all route to manage all requests to `/api/auth/*` (or any other path specified in your Better Auth options).

```ts title="server.ts"
import express from "express";
import { toNodeHandler } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = express();
const port = 3005;

app.get("/api/auth/*", toNodeHandler(auth));

app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

After completing the setup, start your server. Better Auth will be ready to use. You can send a `GET` request to the `/ok` endpoint (`/api/auth/ok`) to verify that the server is running.
