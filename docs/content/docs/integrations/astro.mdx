description: Integrate Better Auth with Astro
---

Better auth comes with first class support for Astro. This guide will show you how to integrate better auth with Astro.

## Installation

First, install Better Auth

```package-install
npm install better-auth
```

## Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

**Set Secret**

Random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. You can generate one using the button below or you can use something like openssl.
```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
```

<GenerateSecret/>


## Configure Better Auth


### Create Better Auth instance

Create a `auth.ts` file in one of these directories: 

- `.` (root directory)
- `lib/`
- `src/`
- `utils/`

This file will contain your Better Auth instance.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { BetterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = new BetterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite", //change this to your database provider
        url: "./db.sqlite", // path to your database or connection string
    },
})
```

### Migrate the database

You'll need to run the migration command to create the necessary tables in the database.

```bash
npx better-auth migrate
```

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to a catch all API route. Create a file inside `/page/api/auth` called `[...all].ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="page/api/auth/[...all].ts" 
import { auth } from "~/auth";
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";

export const ALL: APIRoute = async (ctx) => {
	return auth.handler(ctx.request);
};
```

<Callout>
    You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/auth/[...all]`
</Callout>

## Create a client

Astro supports multiple frontend frameworks, so you can easily import your client based on the framework you're using.

If you're not using a frontend framework, you can still import the vanilla client.

            export const client = createAuthClient()
            ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Auth Middleware 

To protect your routes, you can check if the user is authenticated using the `getSession` method in middleware. Start by creating a `middleware.ts` file in the root of your project and follow the example below:

```ts title="middleware.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
	const isAuthed = await auth.api
		.getSession({
			headers: context.request.headers,
		})
	if (context.url.pathname === "/dashboard" && !isAuthed) {
		return context.redirect("/");
	}
	return next();
});
```

## Getting session on the server inside .astro file

You can use `auth.api` to call the API from the server side. Here is an example of how you can get the session inside an `.astro` file:

```astro
---
import { UserCard } from "@/components/user-card";
import { auth } from "@/auth";

const activeSessions = await auth.api
	.listSessions({
		headers: Astro.request.headers,
	});

const session = await auth.api.getSession({
	headers: Astro.request.headers,
});
---

<UserCard initalSession={session} />
```
