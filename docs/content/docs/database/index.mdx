---

Better auth requires a database connection to store data. Better auth comes with a built in database mangment using <Link href="https://kysely.dev/"> Kysley </Link> to manage the database. The database will be used to store data such as users, sessions, and more. Plugins can also define their own database tables to store data.

You can pass a database connection to better auth by passing a `database` object to the `betterAuth` function. The `database` object should have a `provider` key that specifies the database provider to use. By default, better auth support `postgres`, `mysql` and `sqlite`. You can also pass a kysley dialect directly to use other databases supported by kysley. The `database` object can also have a `url` key that specifies the database connection to use. If you're using `sqlite`, you can pass a file path in the `url` key.

**Example: Sqlite**
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite",
        url: "path/to/database.sqlite"
    }
})
```

**Example: Postgres**
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth
export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "postgres",
        url: "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
    }
})
```

**Exmaple: Mysql**
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth
export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "mysql",
        url: "mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database"
    }
})
```

**Exmaple: Custom Dialect**
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { LibsqlDialect } from "@libsql/kysely-libsql";

export const auth = await betterAuth({
   	database: new LibsqlDialect({
		url: process.env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL || "",
		authToken: process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN || "",
	}),
})
```
