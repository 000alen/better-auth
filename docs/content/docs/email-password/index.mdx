Email and password authentication is a common method used by many applications. Better Auth provides a robust and secure way to authenticate users using email and password with minimal effort.

## Getting Started

Email and password authentication is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to enable the email and password authenticator in the Better Auth configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';

export const auth = betterAuth({
  //...other configurations
  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
  },
})
```
<Callout>
Unless you explicitly enable the email and password authenticator, it will not allow users to sign up or sign in using email and password.
