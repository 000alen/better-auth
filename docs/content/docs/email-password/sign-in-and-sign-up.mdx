Email and password authentication is a common authentication method used by many applications. It involves users entering their email and password to log in. Better Auth provides a built-in email and password authenticator that you can use to authenticate users.

  If you want to use username as an identifier you can use <Link href="/docs/plugins/username">username plugin</Link>. It wraps the email and password authenticator and adds username support.

## Signup and Signin with Email

To use email and password authentication, you need to configure the email and password authenticator. You can do this by adding the following code to your better auth instance:

```ts title="auth.ts" twoslash 
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const { api, handler } = await betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite",
        url: "./db.sqlite",
    },
    emailAndPassword: {    // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```

<Callout type="info">
If it's not enabled, it'll not allow you to sign in or sign up with email and password.
</Callout>

### Signup

To signup a user, you can use the `signUp.email` function provided by the client. The `signUp` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user. It should be at least 8 characters long and max 32 by default. 
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `image`: The image of the user. (optional)
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed up. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash /
/**
 * Make sure to import the client for your framework
 */
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()

const signup = async () => {
    const data = await client.signUp.email({
        email: "test@example.com",
        password: "password1234",
        name: "test",
        image: "https://example.com/image.png",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```

The function returns a promise that resolves an object with `data` and `error` properties. The `data` property contains the user object that was created, and the `error` property contains any error that occurred during the signup process.

<Callout type="info">
Hover over the `data` object to see the shape of the response.
</Callout>

### Signin

To signin a user, you can use the `signIn.email` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user.
- `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed in. (optional)

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash 
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const client = createAuthClient()

const signin = async () => {
    const data = await client.signIn.email({
        email: "test@example.com",
        password: "password1234",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```

### Email Verification

To enable email verification, you need to configure the email and password authenticator. You can do this by adding the following code to your better auth instance:

```ts title="auth.ts" twoslash

import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const { api, handler } = await betterAuth({
    // ---cut-start---
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite",
        url: "./db.sqlite"
    },
    // ---cut-end---
    emailAndPassword: {    
        enabled: true, 
        async sendVerificationEmail(email, url){
            // send email to user.
        }
    }
})
```

on the client side you can use `sendVerificationEmail` function to send verification link to user.

```ts title="client.ts" twoslash  
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const client = createAuthClient()
// ---cut---
const verifyEmail = async () => {
    const data = await client.sendVerificationEmail({
	    email: "test@example.com",
        callbackURL: "/"
    })
}
```
