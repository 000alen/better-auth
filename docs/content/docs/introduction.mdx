Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code and very short amount time. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your actual application instead of reinventing the wheel. 

## Why Better Auth?

Currently, the open-source libraries in the ecosystem often require a lot of additional code if you want anything beyond a basic login. Instead of just suggesting 3rd party services when that happens (which can be still be the right choice at times), I think we can do better as a communityâ€”hence, Better Auth.

## Features

Better auth is aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:
