Better Auth is framework-agnostic authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities with minimal code. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenant support, or other complex features. It lets you focus on building your app instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Why Better Auth?

> Currently, most open-source libraries handle basic authentication, but when you need something more, they often require a lot of additional code. When that happens, instead of just suggesting 3rd party services (which are the right choice in some cases), I think we can do better as a communityâ€”hence, Better Auth.

## Features

Better auth is aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:
