## Why Better Auth?

*Hi there, I’m <Link href="https://x.com/imbereket" target="_blank">Beka</Link>, the creator of Better Auth. I’ve often found that working with TypeScript auth libraries means dealing with a ton of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication, which is just a huge time sink. I thought we could do better than pushing third-party providers for something that can be provided as a library, so I built Better Auth.*
