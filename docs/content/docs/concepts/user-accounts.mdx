Beyond authenticating users, Better auth also provides a set of functions to manage users. This includes, updating user information, changing passwords, and more.

## User table

The user table stores the user data. The user table has the following fields:

- `id`: The user id.
- `email`: The email of the user.
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `image`: The image of the user.
- `createdAt`: The creation date of the user.
- `updatedAt`: The last update date of the user.

The user table can be extended by plugins to store additional data. When a plugin extends a user table it's infered by the type system and can be used in the client.

## Update User

### Update User Information

To update user information, you can use the `updateUser` function provided by the client. The `updateUser` function takes an object with the following properties:

```ts
await user.update({
    image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    name: "John Doe",
})
```

### Change Password

Password of a user isn't stored in the user table. Instead, it's stored in the account table. To change the password of a user, you can use the `changePassword` function provided by the client. The `changePassword` function takes an object with the following properties:

```ts
await user.changePassword({
    newPassword: "newPassword123",
    currentPassword: "oldPassword123",
    revokeOtherSessions: true, // revoke all other sessions the user is signed into
});
```

## Account linking

Account linking allows users to link multiple authentication methods to the same account. This is useful when users want to sign in using different methods.

Better auth automatically handles account linking when users sign in using different methods. This works by checking if the provider returns `emailVerified` field. If the field is present, Better Auth will link the account to the existing user account.

more sophisticated account linking feature will be added in the future.
