---

When you create a new Better Auth instance, you get an object called `api` with a set of functions that you can use to interact with the server.

Any endpoint added on the server will be available on the `api` object.

## Calling API on the Server

Better auth uses a library called [better-call](https://github.com/bekacru/better-call) to make API endpoints. It's a library made by the same team behind Better Auth and is designed to work seamlessly with it.Better call endpoints allow you to call `rest` api handlers as if they were normal functions.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "sqlite",
        url: "./db.sqlite",
    },
    plugins: [
        // add your plugins here
    ]
})

// calling sign in email on the server
await auth.api.signInEmail({
    body: {
        email: "",
        password: ""
    }
})
```

**Example: Getting the current Session**

```ts title="server.ts"
import { headers } from "next/server";

// calling get session on the server
await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: headers()
})
```


## Handling Errors

Unlike the client, the server doesn't return error as a value, instead it throws an error. You can use a try/catch block to handle errors.

```ts title="server.ts"
try {
    await auth.api.signInEmail({
        body: {
            email: "",
            password: ""
        }
    })
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
}
```

<Callout>
    On some cases, the server will return an error object or just a value that indicates non successful value. Mostly, the server will throw an error.
