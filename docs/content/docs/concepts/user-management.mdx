Beyond authenticating users, Better auth also provides a set of functions to manage users. This includes, updating user information, changing passwords, and more.

## User table

The user table stores the user data. The user table has the following fields:

- `id`: The user id.
- `email`: The email of the user.
- `name`: The name of the user.
- `image`: The image of the user.
- `createdAt`: The creation date of the user.
- `updatedAt`: The last update date of the user.

The user table can be extended by plugins to store additional data. When a plugin extends a user table it's infered by the type system and can be used in the client.

## Update User

### Update User Information

To update user information, you can use the `updateUser` function provided by the client. The `updateUser` function takes an object with the following properties:

```ts
await user.update({
    image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    name: "John Doe",
})
```

### Change Password

Password of a user isn't stored in the user table. Instead, it's stored in the account table. To change the password of a user, you can use the `changePassword` function provided by the client. The `changePassword` function takes an object with the following properties:

```ts
await user.changePassword({
    newPassword: "newPassword123",
    currentPassword: "oldPassword123",
    revokeOtherSessions: true, // revoke all other sessions the user is signed into
});
```
