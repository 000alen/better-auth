description: Account linking allows users to link multiple authentication methods to the same account

Account linking allows users to link multiple authentication methods to the same account. This is useful when users want to sign in using different methods.

Better auth automatically handles account linking when users sign in using different methods. This works by checking if the provider returns `emailVerified` field. If the field is present, Better Auth will link the account to the existing user account.

more sophisticated account linking feature will be added in the future.
