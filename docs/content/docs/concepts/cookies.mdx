description: Learn how cookies are used in BetterAuth

Cookies are used to store data such as session tokens, CSRF tokens, and more. All cookies are signed using the `secret` key provided in the auth options.

Core better auth cookies like `session` and `csrf` will follow `betterauth.${cookie_name}` format. 

All cookies are `httpOnly` and `secure` if the server is running in production mode. 

### Cross Subdomain Cookies

By default, cookies aren't shared across subdomains. You can enable cross subdomain cookies by setting `crossSubDomainCookies.enabled` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    adavaned: {
        crossSubDomainCookies: {
            enabled: true,
            domain: "example.com" // Optional. Defaults to the base url domain
        }
    }
})
```

### Disable CSRF Cookie (Not Recommended)

If you want to disable the CSRF cookie, you can set `disableCsrfCheck` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    adavaned: {
        disableCsrfCheck: true
    }
})
```

### Secure Cookies

By default, cookies are secure if the server is running in production mode. You can force cookies to be secure by setting `useSecureCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = await betterAuth({
    adavaned: {
        useSecureCookies: true
    }
})
```
