The username plugin wraps the email and password authenticator and adds username support. This allows users to sign in and sign up with their username instead of their email.

    <Step>
        ### Add Plugin to the server

        ```ts title="auth.ts" twoslash
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { username } from "better-auth/plugins"

        const auth = await betterAuth({
            database: {
                provider: "sqlite",
                url: "./db.sqlite",
            },
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                username() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin
        
        ```ts title="client.ts" twoslash
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        
        const client = createAuthClient({
            authPlugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                usernameClient // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Signup with username

        To signup a user with username, you can use the `signUp.username` function provided by the client. The `signUp` function takes an object with the following properties:

        - `username`: The username of the user.
        - `email`: The email address of the user.
        - `password`: The password of the user. It should be at least 8 characters long and max 32 by default. 
        - `name`: The name of the user.
        - `image`: The image of the user. (optional)
        - `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed up. (optional)

        ```ts title="client.ts" twoslash
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        const client = createAuthClient({
            authPlugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                usernameClient // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        // ---cut---
        
        const data = await client.signUp.username({
            username: "test",
            email: "test@email.com",
            password: "password1234",
            name: "test",
            image: "https://example.com/image.png",
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Signin with username

        To signin a user with username, you can use the `signIn.username` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

        - `username`: The username of the user.
        - `password`: The password of the user.
        - `callbackURL`: The url to redirect to after the user has signed in. (optional)

        ```ts title="client.ts" twoslash
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        const client = createAuthClient({
            authPlugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                usernameClient // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        // ---cut---
        
        const data = await client.signIn.username({
            username: "test",
            password: "password1234",
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

The username plugin doesn't require any configuration. It just needs to be added to the server and client.

## Database Schema

The username plugin requires a `username` field in the user table. If you're using better auth migration tool it will automatically add the `username` field to the user table. If not you can add it manually.

```ts
const shcmea = {
    user: {
        username: {
            type: "string",
            unique: true,
            required: false
        }
    }
}
```
