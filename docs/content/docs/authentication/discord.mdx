        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts" 
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { discord } from "better-auth/social-providers"
        
        export const auth = await betterAuth({
            database: {
                provider: "sqlite",
                url: "./db.sqlite",
            },
            socialProviders: { // [!code highlight]
                discord: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Signin with Discord 
        To signin with Discord, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `discord`.

        ```ts title="client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const client = createAuthClient()
        
        const signin = async () => {
            const data = await client.signIn.social({
                provider: "discord"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
