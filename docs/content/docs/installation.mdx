<Steps>
    <Step>
         ### Install better-auth
        start by installing better-auth package. You need this both on the server and client

        ```package-install
        better-auth
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Environment Variables
        Better auth requries a secret. This is a random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. You can generate one using the button below or you can use something like openssl.
        ```txt title=".env.local"
        BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
        ```
        <GenerateSecret/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Create Server
        better auth requries a file called `auth.ts` or `auth.config.ts` to be present in the root directory or one of the following directories:
        - `lib/`
        - `utils/`

        any of these directories can also be nested under `src/` directory.

        ```ts twoslash title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            database: {
                provider: "sqlite", // or "mysql", "postgresql"
                url: "./db.sqlite", // path to your database
            }
        })
        ```
        <Callout type="info"> 
           Better Auth currently supports only SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It uses Kysely under the hood, so you can also pass any Kysely dialect directly to the database object.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Providers
        better auth comes with email and password authenticator and social sign-on providers. You can configure them in the auth object.
        ```ts
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { github } from "better-auth/social-providers"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            database: {
                provider: "sqlite",
                url: "./db.sqlite",
            },
            socialProvider: [
                github({
                    clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID as string,
                    clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
                }),
            ],
            emailAndPassword: {
                enabled: true
            }
        });
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate Database
        better auth comes with a cli tool to migrate your database. You can run the following command to migrate your database.
        ```bash
        npx better-auth migrate
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Mount Handler
        After creating an instance, mount the handler on the appropriate server route so it can listen and respond to authentication requests. Ensure this file is placed in your framework's catch-all directory, where the base path is `/api/auth`. 

        <Tabs items={["next-js", "svelte-kit", "nuxt", "solid-start", "hono"]} defaultValue="react">
            <Tab value="next-js">
                ```ts title="api/[...auth]/route.ts"
                import { auth } from "~/utils/auth.config"
                import { toNextJSHandler } from "better-auth/next-js"

                export const { GET, POST } = toNextJSHandler(auth)
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Create Client

            <Tab value="vanilla">
